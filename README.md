# Cognitive Trainer for Computer Science Professionals

Within the realm of systems programming and development, computer science professionals are regularly faced with intangible technical challenges that require accurate and decisive resolution—an analytical skill that is traditionally not exercised until it must be applied, often with varying success. To these ends, research has shown that routine engagement of activities which stimulate critical thinking can lead to neuroplasticity, increasing one’s ability to more quickly and precisely apply their knowledge at higher-orders of cognizance/domains of [Bloom’s Taxonomy](https://bloomstaxonomy.net/). This project is one such proposed application to facilitate thought and ability development of this nature, requiring minimal time commitment, with the additional benefit of taking place in a zero-stakes environment.

## Compile/Build

Please note: Utilizing versions other than the one specified below may result in unexpected program behavior. The '/Library' directory and its contents are not committed within this repo; these cache files will be generated automatically following importation. If managing multiple projects, you may also wish to install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) in order to more easily facilitate the following.

1. Download Unity Editor LTS version 2021.3.16f1: https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.16
2. Download contents of the '/src' directory: https://github.com/jflum/CSU-Senior-Project/tree/master/src
3. Within the IDE, click **File > Open Project...** and selection the '/src' directory from the previous step.
4. Once importation has completed click **File > Build And Run** to launch a local web instance.
