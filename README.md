Within the realm of systems programming and development, computer science professionals are regularly faced with intangible technical challenges that require accurate and decisive resolution—an analytical skill that is traditionally not exercised until it must be applied, often with varying success. To these ends, research has shown that routine engagement of activities which stimulate critical thinking can lead to neuroplasticity, increasing one’s ability to more quickly and precisely apply their knowledge at higher-orders of cognizance/domains of Bloom’s taxonomy. This project is one such proposed application to facilitate thought and ability development of this nature, requiring minimal time commitment, with the additional benefit of taking place in a zero-stakes environment.
